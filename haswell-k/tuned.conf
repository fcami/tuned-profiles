# Minimal preemption granularity for CPU-bound tasks:
# (default: 1 msec#  (1 + ilog(ncpus)), units: nanoseconds)
kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns = 100000

# SCHED_OTHER wake-up granularity.
# (default: 1 msec#  (1 + ilog(ncpus)), units: nanoseconds)

# This option delays the preemption effects of decoupled workloads
# and reduces their over-scheduling. Synchronous workloads will still
# have immediate wakeup/sleep latencies.

# If a workload mostly uses anonymous memory and it hits this limit, the entire
# working set is buffered for I/O, and any more write buffering would require
# swapping, so it's time to throttle writes until I/O can catch up.  Workloads
# that mostly use file mappings may be able to use even higher values.
#
# The generator of dirty data starts writeback at this percentage (system default
# is 20%)

# Start background writeback (via writeback threads) at this percentage (system
# default is 10%)
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 1
# or after 200 centisecs (default is 500)
vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 200
# so that recent data has a chance to hit the disk

# The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move
# processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk.
# 0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory
# for as long as possible
# 100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory
# and move them to swap cache
